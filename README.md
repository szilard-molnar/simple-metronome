# simple-metronome

This is a simple metronome application for musicians to be able to play in time. 

Before clicking the "Start" button the user needs to pick a meter, right now it can be 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4. After that the user needs to pick a tempo, which can be anything between 40 and 200 beats per minute. 

After clicking that "Start" button the user will visually see the beats appearing on the screen. The application can be stopped anytime by pressing the "Stop" button.
